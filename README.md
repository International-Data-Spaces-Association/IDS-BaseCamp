**IDS Basecamp**

The IDS basecamp is a software distribution of components to build and operate an IDS Data Space. It's a project build from an OSS repository which integrates contributions from differnet projects to allow us to work on a common code basis which: 

- makes it easy for data spaces to work on a basis of integrated components which are proven in productive environments
- allows all contributors to participate from the learnings and also investements from other projects 

The goal is to enable developers, testbeds and productive systems to be able to work on a common basis and leverage the power of many to constantly improve the code set whilst maintaining the highest level of interoperability. At the same time the efforts of project teams can shift from setup and integration of basic services towards the value of creating use cases. It includes experiences from commercial operators with validated security, scalability and maintainability requirements and is used in productive environments. It does not contain any proprietary elements and the project is available to all parties willing to contribute. It can be extended with additional components and services (like onboarding workflows, integration with ID or certificate providers, testbeds, different type of connectors). 

The general approach in building a distribution is a community process following the schema: 
- intensive research with the community on available software assets  
- improvement of the code base towards a production grade technical readiness level 
- packaging towards an integrated distribution  

Governance: IDSA assumes the role of GitHub Maintainer of the repository to ensure contributions by the committers are aligned with the IDSA reference architecture and specifications

v 1.0 of the Basecamp is a distribution following IDS RAM 4.0 and the EDC MS 0.8.

It consists of the following IDS based infrastructure components: 
CA, DAPS, ParIS, Metadata Broker, Transaction Log (Clearing House)
