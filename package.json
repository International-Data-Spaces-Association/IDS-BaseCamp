  "description": "Similar to the [Testbed](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed), the IDS-BaseCamp provides developers functioning components with just enough features to be usable for a secure and sovereign data exchange, yet its intended purpose is to enable developers to experiment with their own ideas and implement their visions, as out-of-pocket as they may be, in it, without any regard to the standardized specifications of the IDSA. This playground for ideas can be used before trying out a developers idea to the Testbed, in which it would have to adhere to certain guidelines.",
