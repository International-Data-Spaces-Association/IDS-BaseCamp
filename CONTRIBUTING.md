# Contributing to the IDS Base Camp

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the IDS Base Camp. You are very
welcome to contribute to this project when you find a bug, want to suggest an improvement, or have
an idea for a useful feature. For this, always create an issue and a corresponding branch, and
follow our style guides as described below.

Please note that we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that all contributors should stick to.

## Changelog

We document changes in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) on root level which is formatted and
maintained according to the rules documented on http://keepachangelog.com.

## Issues

You always have to create an issue if you want to integrate a bugfix, improvement, or feature.
Briefly and clearly describe the purpose of your contribution in the corresponding issue.
The pre-defined [labels](#labels) improve the understanding of your intentions and help to follow
the scope of your changes.

**Bug Report**: As mentioned above, bug reports should be submitted as an issue. To give others
the chance to reproduce the error in order to find a solution as quickly as possible, the report
should at least include the following information:
* Description: What did you expect and what happened instead?
* Steps to reproduce (system specs included)
* Relevant logs and/or media (optional): e.g. an image

## Labels

The [labels](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector/labels) are listed at the
[issues](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector/issues).
There are three types of labels: the `type` describes the content of the issue, `scope` helps to
specify the scope of the issue. The `open for contribution` label can be seen as an invitation to
contribute to the project. Independent functionalities and improvements that will not be implemented
by the core developer team are marked with it.

## Branches

After creating an issue yourself or if you want to address an existing issue, you have to create a
branch with a unique number and name that assigns it to an issue. Therefore, follow the guidelines
at https://deepsource.io/blog/git-branch-naming-conventions/. After your changes, update the
`README.md`, `/docs`, and `CHANGELOG.md` with necessary details. Then, create a pull request and note
that **committing to the main branch is not allowed**. Please use the feature `linked issues` to
link issues and pull requests. To mark your pull request as `work in progress`, please use the
provided GitHub feature. Contributions to the main branch will be squashed and merged.

## Commits

We encourage all contributors to stick to the commit convention following the specification on
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). In general, use  the
imperative in the present tense. A quick overview of the schema:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

Types: `fix`, `feat`, `chore`, `test`, `refactor`, `docs`, `release`. Append `!` for breaking
changes to a type.

An example of a very good commit might look like this: `feat![login]: add awesome breaking feature`

**Pay attention to never push your IDS keystore or certificate to the repository - not in a single
commit! Therefore, the `resources/conf` directory is added to the `.gitignore`.**

## Versioning
The Dataspace Connector uses the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning. The release versions
are tagged with their respective version.
